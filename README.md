# Sajal's-Team-Profile-Generator

##Description
I was tasked with creating a team profile generator by using node.js. The generator generates a profile consisting of a manager, interns, and engineers. Along with this, it also includes their information, like their name, email, and ID number. Each employee type has a specific attribute. Managers have an office number, interns, have a school or university, and engineers have a link to their GitHub.
