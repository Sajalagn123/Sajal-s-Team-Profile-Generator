# Sajal's-Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
I was tasked with creating a team profile generator by using node.js. The generator generates a profile consisting of a manager, interns, and engineers. Along with this, it also includes their information, like their name, email, and ID number. Each employee type has a specific attribute. Managers have an office number, interns, have a school or university, and engineers have a link to their GitHub.

## Installation 
To install my project, I created a repository for it on Github. After that I cloned the repository onto my desktop. I then copied the folders from my class repository and pasted them into my folder. From there, I opened the assignments into a serperate folder.

## Usage
Users will be able to generate a profile for their professional team dynamically.

## License
None

## Contributions
